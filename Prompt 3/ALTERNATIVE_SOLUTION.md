# Alternative Solution: Spacelift Variable Prompts

## The Real Issue
Since there's no "Blueprint" section in stack settings, your Spacelift instance either:
1. Doesn't have the Blueprint feature enabled
2. Uses a different approach for user input prompts
3. Requires a different configuration

## ✅ Solution 1: Use Spacelift Environment Variables with Prompts

Instead of relying on Blueprints, we can configure the stack to prompt for variables through the Spacelift UI.

### Step 1: Configure Variables in Stack Settings
1. Go to your stack in Spacelift
2. Navigate to **Environment** tab
3. Add these as **Environment Variables**:

```
TF_VAR_aws_account_id = (leave value empty - mark as "write-only" if you want prompts)
TF_VAR_developer_name = (leave value empty)
```

### Step 2: Alternative - Use Spacelift Contexts
1. Create a **Context** in Spacelift
2. Add variables there and attach to stack
3. Mark variables as requiring input

## ✅ Solution 2: Create a Simple Interface Stack

Let's create a simpler approach that works with standard Spacelift features:

1. **Manual Variable Input**: Users set variables through Spacelift UI
2. **Trigger Stack**: Users manually trigger the stack after setting variables
3. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear guidance on what variables to set
